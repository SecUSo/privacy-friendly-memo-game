Privacy Friendly Memo Game is a card game. The task is to find matching pairs within the cards. The application does not use any permission, which means it can provide its full functionality without the usage of permissions and it does not include advertisement nor tracking mechanisms.

## Motivation 

As it is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group of the Technische 
Universtität Darmstadt in Germany it is optimized due to user's privacy. More information can be found here [secuso.org/pfa].

## Building

Further development requires Android Studio.
