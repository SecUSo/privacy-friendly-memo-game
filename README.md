## Privacy Friendly Memory

Privacy Friendly Memory is a card game. The application does not use any permission, which means it can provide its full functionality without the usage of permissions and it does not include advertisement nor tracking mechanisms.

## Motivation 

As it is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group of the Technische 
Universtität Darmstadt in Germany it is optimized due to user's privacy.

## Installation

Further development requires Android Studio.

### API Reference
